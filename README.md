# Projects

Small projects to demonstrate different aspects of coding.

- Resistors: convert resistor colour into number of ohms
- Triangles: classify type of triange based on side lengths
- Queens: given the position of two queens on a chessboard, figure out if they can attack each other
  - Extend this by adding other pieces!

# Coding Challenges

- Scoring poker hands
- Scoring Yahtzee

- Extend:
  - allow the user to play
  - supor hard bonus: play against the computer!

## Some projects

- **Roguelike game**: based on the game we developed in class, but with some fixes so it works.
- **Minesweeper**: demonstrating 2d arrays.
- **Enigma**: an attempt at implementing the basic Enigma machine, with some explanations in the readme file.

### Please fix my code! üíú üëê

I would greatly appreciate if the code fairies could visit Roguelike and Mines. They could greatly benefit from a good
refactoring! There is lots of repeated code which is crying out to be put into separate functions.

While you're in there, feel free to extend the games in any way you wish.
